This code calculates the internal rate of return for series of cashflows using the Newton-Raphson method. The code is implemented in C#. The maximum number of iterations as well as the convergence interval are configurable using the app.config.


Feel free to modify the source code. Implementations in Python, Pascal and C++ are available on request.
